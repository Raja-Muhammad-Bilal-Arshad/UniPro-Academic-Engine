## 🏆 Evaluation Criteria Alignment

This application was engineered specifically to excel in the following areas:

| Criteria                  | Implementation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Innovation & Creativity   | Split-Window Technology: Unlike standard chatbots, UniPro separates Code (implementation) from Theory (learning) and Visualization (results), simulating a real developer environment.                                                                                    |
| Functionality & Usability | 6 Specialized Modules: A comprehensive suite covering the entire student lifecycle, from homework to thesis defense, wrapped in a responsive React UI.                                                                                                                   |
| Impact & Usefulness       | Educational Focus: We don't just solve problems; we explain the Big-O complexity and Architectural Patterns, ensuring students learn while they build.                                                                                                                   |
| Prompt Quality            | Chain-of-Thought System: Utilizes advanced XML-structured prompts to force the AI into rigid logical reasoning and artifact separation.                                                                                                                                   |

## 📦 Core Modules
